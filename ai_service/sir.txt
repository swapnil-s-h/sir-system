[SECTION: BOILER_MAINTENANCE_SCHEDULE]
Source: Forbes Marshall Boiler House Maintenance Guidelines
Frequency: DAILY_CHECKS
1. Check water level in the gauge glass; verify it is clear and moving freely.
2. Perform 'Blowdown' of the boiler to remove sludge and sediment (bottom blowdown).
3. Check feed water tank level and temperature (ideal temp: 85°C - 95°C for deaeration).
4. Monitor Flue Gas Temperature (FGT). A rise in FGT indicates scaling on tubes.
5. Check fuel oil pressure and temperature (for oil-fired boilers).
6. Verify operation of the feed water pump; check for abnormal noise or vibration.
7. Inspect the burner flame for stability and correct color (bright orange/yellow for oil, blue for gas).

Frequency: WEEKLY_CHECKS
1. Test the Low Water Cut-off (LWCO) device to ensure the burner trips when water is low.
2. Check the operation of the Mobrey Level Controller.
3. Inspect and clean the fuel oil filters and strainers.
4. Check tension of V-belts on the blower/fan motors.
5. Lubricate bearings of pumps and motors if required.
6. Verify the chemical dosing system is functioning (check tank level and pump stroke).

Frequency: MONTHLY_CHECKS
1. Clean the smoke tubes (fire tubes) to remove soot deposits (soot acts as an insulator).
2. Inspect the refractory lining of the furnace door for cracks or damage.
3. Check and clean the electrode tips of the ignition system.
4. Clean the photo-sensor (flame scanner) lens.
5. Inspect all steam traps in the boiler house for correct operation (no steam blowing).

Frequency: ANNUAL_CHECKS (SHUTDOWN)
1. Complete descaling of the boiler (water side) using inhibited acid.
2. Hydraulic Pressure Test (Hydro Test) at 1.5 times the working pressure (as per IBR/ASME).
3. Calibration of all pressure gauges and temperature sensors.
4. Overhaul of all mountings: Main Steam Stop Valve, Safety Valves, Feed Check Valves.
5. NDT (Non-Destructive Testing) of weld joints if required by regulation.

[SECTION: CONTROL_VALVE_MAINTENANCE]
Source: Forbes Marshall Control Valve Asset Management
Type: Pneumatic Diaphragm Control Valves / Piston Valves

Frequency: PREVENTIVE_MAINTENANCE
1. Air Filter Regulator (AFR): Drain moisture daily. Clean the sintered filter cartridge monthly.
2. Gland Packing: Check for stem leakage. Tighten gland nuts evenly. If leak persists, replace Graphoil/PTFE packing.
3. Actuator Diaphragm: Inspect for air leaks (hissing sound) around the casing. Replace rubber diaphragm every 2 years.
4. Valve Positioner: Check for 'hunting' (oscillation). Calibrate Zero (4mA) and Span (20mA).
5. Stem Connector: Ensure the lock-nut connecting the actuator stem and valve stem is tight.

[SECTION: INDUSTRY_STANDARDS_AND_TESTING]
Standard: ASME Section I (Power Boilers) & Section VII (Care of Power Boilers)
- Safety Valve Setting: The lifting pressure must not exceed the MAWP (Maximum Allowable Working Pressure) by more than 6% (or as defined by local code).
- Water Quality Limits (Typical for Shell Boilers up to 20 Bar):
  - pH: 10.5 - 12.0
  - Total Dissolved Solids (TDS): Max 3500 ppm
  - Hardness: < 5 ppm (ideally zero)
  - Dissolved Oxygen: < 0.05 ppm

Standard: API 598 (Valve Inspection and Testing)
- Shell Test: Pressure test of the valve body at 1.5x rated pressure. No visible leakage allowed.
- Seat Leakage Test (Closure Test):
  - Test Pressure: 1.1x rated pressure.
  - Allowable Leakage for Metal Seated Valves: Small amount of bubbles/drops allowed (e.g., 0.1 ml/min per inch of size).
  - Allowable Leakage for Soft Seated Valves: Zero leakage (Bubble-tight).

[SECTION: TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE]
Problem: "Boiler water level unstable"
Possible Cause: Foaming due to high TDS or oil in water.
Action: Check TDS level, perform blowdown, check feed water quality.

Problem: "Burner fails to fire"
Possible Cause: No fuel, photocell dirty, electrode gap incorrect, blower trip.
Action: Check fuel tank, clean scanner, reset burner controller.

Problem: "Control valve hunting (fluctuating)"
Possible Cause: Loose gland packing, positioner calibration error, sticking stem.
Action: Tighten packing, auto-calibrate positioner, check air supply pressure (should be stable, typically 2-4 bar).

Problem: "Steam Trap blowing live steam"
Possible Cause: Worn out internals, dirt in seat.
Action: Clean strainer, replace trap internals (kit).
